# Designing-a-minimum-distance-to-class-mean-classifier
the objectives of this experiment is to know how a simple classifier works. The classifier implemented in this experiment may not work correctly in all situation but the purpose to know how a classifier works can be accomplished. Firstly in the introduction section we will discuss the basic things of a classifier and also we will know what includes in our experiment. Then we will go for the implementation of our experiment. We will use MATLAB tools to implement our classifier. After that we will perform a simple result analysis on the result. Then we will conclude our experiment.
